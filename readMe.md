## BATTLESHIP

Player vs Computer.

Both will start with the exact same amount of ships:

 1) Destroyer : 2 tiles
 2) Cruiser : 3 tiles
 3) Submarine : 3 tiles
 4) Battleship : 4 tiles
 5) Aircraft Carrier: 5 tiles


Each player will start to place their ships into their own respective grids. Player has a choice to either place their ship horizontally or vertically.

The computer's ships placement and orientation are randomly generated the moment you start the game.

Once you're done placing your ships, click on the start button to start the game!


## GAME OBJECTIVE
The objective of the game is to sink all five (5) of your opponent's ship! If you sink them all before they sink yours, you will win the game.


## HOW TO PLAY
Player will be able to sink computer's ships by clicking on the squares in the computer's grid. 

If the square turn blue -- It means that you've missed the ship, and your missiles hit the waters.
If the square turns red -- It means that you've hit 1 tile of the ship.

Your job is to figure out where and how did your opponent place their ship (horizontally / vertically) in their grids so that you can sink all five (5) of them. 

GOOD LUCK!
