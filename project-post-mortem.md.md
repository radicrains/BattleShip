## Project Post Mortem
Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

### What to Bring
Please answer the following questions. Take at least 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
Time management. I felt that i spent a lot of my time worrying what game should i choose, as i was afraid i couldnt do it. At times it does feel nerve wrecking, but i have to tell myself that it is okay. Everyone is at their own pace. 


2. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
Seeking opinions from my family. I realised that they may not be able to help you code, but they will be able to help give feedback on the asthetics / playability of the game. & to always breakdown your games to functions and tackle the functions one by one.  




#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
 If i had more time, to sit and figure out why my jQuery didnt worked when i try element.hasClass('SqUsed). Because of this error, I used vanilla JS to code my games. To understand & find better APIs. To refactor my codes properly into Class, as it is pretty messy for me right now.

2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
Learning about vh, vw, calc() & grid-template-rows was very useful for my grid CSS. It was easier to manage the various sizes of ship and their respective orientations. I believed with learning about variables in CSS, my CSS could be refactored. 
 

#### Unit 1 Post Mortem
1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Writing/drawing out the codes helps with my thought process. 

2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
My coding is still pretty basic / old age. Would be awesome if i could be able to improve on refactoring.

3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
The course materials are fine. The homework, i feel that after submission, maybe we can have a QnA / sample to see and compare ourselves so that we know what we can improve on.
